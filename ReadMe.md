# ðŸ§©Introduction

This repository contains original code samples of heuristic optimization or artificially intelligent algorithms and packages developed and maintained by Keivan Tafakkori.

What is unique about the designed algorithms is that they have been developed, keeping in mind the fact that Python is a loop-sensitive algorithm. Therefore, these codes can be much more computationally efficient while being applied to an optimization problem. On the other hand, the goal is to prepare a rapid prototype of such algorithms and promote their usage in, mainly but not limited to, industrial engineering (IE), optimization and operations research (OR), computer science (CS), data science (DS), machine learning (ML) and simulation (SM) fields.

Besides, some heuristic optimization packages are introduced which apply heuristic optimization algorithms right out of the box, and an example for using them is included.

Day by day, this repository will be more and more complete.

Hence, it is kindly requested to support this work by giving a star to the repository to make it available for a broad range of audiences who are interested in using heuristic optimization techniques in the Python programming language.
